The notes are according to the CS61b order currently
1. function in java using public static (return type).
2. all function must be in the class. call method.
3. define the main function using public static void main(String[] args)
4. static function/variable create once it declare and store in the stack during the whole runtime.
5.  Dog smallDog; //variable declaration
    new Dog(20); // instantiation a Dog obj. just go to garbage
    smallDog = new Dog(5);  //instantiate and assignment
    Dog haha = new Dog(200); //declare,instantiate,assignment
    haha.makeNoise(); //invocation
    Dog[] dogs = new Dog[2]; //create an array of size 2 and declare the type to be Dog
    dogs[0]=new Dog(10); //assignment ... just same as single obj
6.  Static shares among the whole class just like python/c++
    static can be called through Dog.xxx -> cannot use non-static variable
    static function need to specify which member to use
